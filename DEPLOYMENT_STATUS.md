## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue: CORS Headers

**Problem:** Frontend cannot load data from backend due to missing CORS headers.

**Error in Browser Console:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://loomlite-production.up.railway.app/tree' 
from origin 'https://loomlite.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

**Root Cause:**
- CORS middleware IS configured in `backend/api.py` (line 30-36)
- But Railway is not returning CORS headers in HTTP responses
- Possible Railway deployment issue or caching

**Current Status:**
- `/concepts` endpoint: 200 OK (but no CORS headers)
- `/tree` endpoint: 500 Internal Server Error
- `/` root: 200 OK (API info page works)

---

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### 1. File Upload
- Upload button visible on: https://loomlite.vercel.app
- Drag-and-drop functionality working
- Frontend ‚Üí Backend communication working

### 2. Document Ingestion
- `/api/ingest` endpoint accepting uploads ‚úÖ
- Job creation working ‚úÖ
- Background processing working ‚úÖ

### 3. GPT-4.1 Extraction
- Model name fixed: gpt-5 ‚Üí gpt-4.1 ‚úÖ
- Temperature parameter added: 0.0 ‚úÖ
- Extraction completing successfully ‚úÖ
- Concepts being saved to database ‚úÖ

### 4. API Endpoints
- `/api/ingest` - POST - Upload documents ‚úÖ
- `/api/jobs` - GET - List all jobs ‚úÖ
- `/api/jobs/{job_id}` - GET - Get job status ‚úÖ
- `/concepts` - GET - List concepts ‚úÖ (but CORS blocked)
- `/tree` - GET - Ontology tree ‚ùå (500 error)

---

## What's Not Working ‚ùå

### 1. CORS Headers Missing
**Impact:** Frontend cannot load data from backend  
**Workaround:** API works fine when called directly (curl, Postman)  
**Fix Needed:** Railway needs to properly deploy CORS middleware

### 2. `/tree` Endpoint Failing
**Error:** HTTP 500 Internal Server Error  
**Impact:** Mind map cannot load ontology tree  
**Likely Cause:** Database query error or missing data

---

## Test Commands That Work

### Upload Document (Direct API)
```bash
python3 /home/ubuntu/test_ingestion.py
```

### Check Concepts (Direct API)
```bash
curl https://loomlite-production.up.railway.app/concepts
```

### Check Job Status
```bash
curl https://loomlite-production.up.railway.app/api/jobs
```

## Deployment URLs

**Frontend:**
- Production: https://loomlite.vercel.app ‚úÖ
- Latest: https://loomlite-2kw2bnr2m-bradys-projects-179e6527.vercel.app ‚úÖ

**Backend:**
- Production: https://loomlite-production.up.railway.app ‚úÖ (but CORS issue)

**GitHub:**
- Repository: https://github.com/Legend1280/loomlite
- Latest commit: 204c756 "Trigger Railway redeploy to apply CORS headers"

---

## Next Steps for Team

### Immediate (15 minutes)

1. **Fix CORS Headers**
   - Verify Railway has deployed latest code
   - Check Railway logs for startup errors
   - May need to manually restart Railway service
   - Alternative: Add CORS headers at Railway edge level

2. **Fix `/tree` Endpoint**
   - Check Railway logs for 500 error details
   - Verify database has data
   - Test query locally

### Short-term (1-2 hours)

3. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Upload document via frontend
   - Wait for extraction to complete
   - Verify concepts appear in mind map

4. **Update Frontend API URL**
   - If CORS can't be fixed, consider using Railway proxy
   - Or deploy backend to Vercel as serverless functions

---

## Files Modified Today

1. `vercel.json` - Fixed to deploy frontend/index.html
2. `backend/extractor.py` - Changed gpt-5 ‚Üí gpt-4.1, added temperature
3. `backend/api.py` - Triggered redeploy (CORS already configured)
4. Created test files:
   - `/home/ubuntu/test_document.txt`
   - `/home/ubuntu/test_ingestion.py`

## Recommended Solution

### Option A: Fix Railway CORS (Preferred)
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Manually restart Railway service
3. Verify CORS headers appear in responses
4. Test frontend again

### Option B: Use Vercel Proxy (Workaround)
1. Add API routes to Vercel frontend
2. Proxy requests to Railway backend
3. Vercel adds CORS headers automatically
4. No Railway changes needed

### Option C: Deploy Backend to Vercel (Alternative)
1. Convert FastAPI to Vercel serverless functions
2. Deploy backend and frontend together
3. No CORS issues (same origin)
4. Simpler deployment
