# Loom Lite - Quick Status Summary

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025 21:35 MDT  
**Status:** üü° PARTIALLY WORKING - Needs debugging

---

## What Works ‚úÖ

1. **File Upload Feature**
   - Upload button visible on production: https://loomlite-2kw2bnr2m-bradys-projects-179e6527.vercel.app
   - Drag-and-drop for PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD, ZIP files
   - Frontend ‚Üí Backend communication working

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/ingest` - Accepts file uploads ‚úÖ
   - `/api/jobs` - Lists all jobs ‚úÖ
   - `/api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get job status ‚úÖ
   - `/concepts` - Returns concepts (empty until extraction works)
   - `/tree` - Returns ontology tree

3. **Deployments**
   - Frontend: Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)
   - Backend: Railway (auto-deploy from GitHub)
   - Both connected and responding

## What's Broken ‚ùå

**CRITICAL BLOCKER:** GPT-4.1 extraction hanging indefinitely

- Jobs created but never complete
- Stuck at "Extracting ontology..." status
- No error messages
- No concepts extracted

**Test Jobs:**
- `job_9251afd90dea` - Stuck for 10+ minutes
- `job_ec471bd5a2d8` - Stuck for 5+ minutes

---

## What Was Fixed Today

1. ‚úÖ **Vercel deployment** - Upload button now appears
2. ‚úÖ **Model name** - Changed from "gpt-5" to "gpt-4.1"
3. ‚úÖ **Temperature** - Added temperature=0.0 parameter

---

## What Needs Debugging

**Primary Issue:** OpenAI API call hanging in `backend/extractor.py` line 122-130

**Possible causes:**
1. Railway hasn't redeployed with new code yet
2. OpenAI API key issue or rate limiting
3. Model name "gpt-4.1" might be incorrect (try "gpt-4o")
4. No timeout set on API call
5. Prompt or chunk size too large

**Action Required:** Team needs to:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify OpenAI API key and model access
3. Add timeout and error handling
4. Test with correct model name
