**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Deployed  
**Commit:** ace2722

## 🐛 Issue

User reported: "the button still doesn't work" and "it's not doing batch"

**Root Cause:**
- Upload button opened file picker ✅
- But only allowed **single file** selection ❌
- No **multi-file** support (`multiple` attribute missing)
- No **progress logging** for debugging
- No **error handling** for failed uploads

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Multi-File Support
```javascript
fileInput.multiple = true;  // Enable multiple file selection
```

### 2. Batch Upload Logic
```javascript
// Upload each file sequentially
for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
  const file = files[i];
  console.log(`→ Uploading ${i+1}/${files.length}: ${file.name}`);
  // ... upload logic
}
```

### 3. Progress Logging
```
📂 3 file(s) selected
→ Uploading 1/3: document1.pdf (245.3 KB)
✅ Uploaded document1.pdf: job_abc123
→ Uploading 2/3: document2.docx (128.7 KB)
✅ Uploaded document2.docx: job_def456
→ Uploading 3/3: notes.txt (5.2 KB)
✅ Uploaded notes.txt: job_ghi789

📊 Upload Summary:
   ✅ Success: 3
   ❌ Failed: 0
   ⏱️  Time: 8.3s
```

### 4. Error Handling
- HTTP status code checking
- Individual file error capture
- Summary with success/fail counts
- Console logging for debugging

### 5. User Feedback
- Real-time console progress
- Summary alert after completion
- Auto-refresh on success
- File input reset for next batch
