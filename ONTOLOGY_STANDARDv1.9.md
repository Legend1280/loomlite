---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the complete data structures, schema, and **user interface standards** for the LoomLite ontology system, version 1.9. This version incorporates a **Hybrid Search Pipeline** that combines lexical fuzzy matching with semantic concept scoring, following industry best practices for scalable, auditable search systems.

**Key Updates in v1.9:**
- Backend-driven search with fuzzy matching and multi-word support
- Weighted fusion of title matching (60%) and concept similarity (40%)
- Dynamic Top Hits that update in real-time with search queries
- Lowered relevance threshold (0.15) to catch fuzzy matches
- Separation of concerns: backend handles scoring, frontend handles rendering

---

## 2. Core Data Structures

- **Document:** Metadata about the source document
- **Concept:** An abstract idea or entity extracted from the document
- **Relation:** A connection between two concepts
- **Span:** A specific text snippet from the original document
- **Mention:** A link between a concept and a span
- **ProvenanceEvent:** (v1.8) A record of a single transformation or action taken on a document

## 3. Schema Definitions

### 3.1. `provenance_events` Table (v1.8)

This table provides an append-only log of all events that occur in the document lifecycle.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | SERIAL | Unique auto-incrementing identifier for the event. |
| `doc_id` | TEXT | The ID of the document this event belongs to. |
| `event_type` | TEXT | The type of event (e.g., `ingested`, `ontology_extracted`, `summaries_generated`). |
| `timestamp` | TIMESTAMP | The timestamp when the event occurred (defaults to `now()`). |
| `actor` | TEXT | The system or user that triggered the event (e.g., `document_reader`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `user_123`). |
| `checksum` | TEXT | The SHA-256 checksum of the document at the time of the event. |
| `semantic_integrity` | REAL | The calculated semantic integrity score after the event. |
| `derived_from` | TEXT[] | An array of parent document IDs if this document was derived from others. |
| `metadata` | JSONB | A flexible JSON blob for storing event-specific details (e.g., `{"concepts_extracted": 48}`). |

### 3.2. `documents` Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | TEXT | Unique identifier for the document. |

## 4. Provenance Tracking Architecture (v1.8)

### 4.1. Overview

The provenance system provides a complete, immutable audit trail for every document, tracking its origin, transformations, and semantic integrity. This is a critical feature for ensuring data quality and providing compliance-ready lineage.

### 4.2. Event Logging Pipeline

| Step | Event | Trigger | Actor |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ingested` | Document upload | `document_reader` |
| 2 | `ontology_extracted` | After concept/relation extraction | `gpt-4.1-mini` |
| 3 | `summaries_generated` | After summary generation | `gpt-4.1-mini` |

### 4.3. Provenance Status Calculation

The `provenance_status` of a document is calculated on-the-fly based on the events in the `provenance_events` table:

| Status | Condition |
|---|---|
| `verified` | All required events (`ingested`, `ontology_extracted`, `summaries_generated`) are present. |
| `partial` | One or more required events are missing. |
| `none` | No provenance events exist for the document. |

## 5. Hybrid Search Architecture (v1.9)

### 5.1. Overview

The search system is a **hybrid lexical-semantic pipeline** that combines fuzzy title matching with concept-based semantic scoring. This architecture follows industry best practices by processing search logic on the backend and using the frontend as a thin UI layer.

**Design Principles:**
- **Backend-first:** All scoring and ranking happens server-side
- **Scalable:** Can handle large document collections efficiently
- **Auditable:** Single source of truth for search logic
- **Extensible:** Ready for vector embedding integration (SNRL v6.0)

### 5.2. Search Pipeline

| Layer | Location | Responsibility | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Pre-process Query** | Frontend | Sanitize, lowercase, debounce typing | JavaScript (searchBar.js) |
| **2. Fuzzy + Multi-term Matching** | Backend | Handle plurals, prefixes, spelling variants | Python (api.py) |
| **3. Concept Scoring** | Backend | Semantic relevance via concept matching | SQLite concepts table |
| **4. Weighted Fusion** | Backend | Combine title + concept scores | 0.6 × title + 0.4 × concept |
| **5. Response Ranking** | Frontend | Display top 6 results in Top Hits | Pure UI (navigatorV2.js) |

### 5.3. Fuzzy Title Matching Algorithm

The backend calculates a match score for each query term against document titles using a hierarchical scoring system:

| Match Type | Score | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact match** | 1.0 | "loom" matches "Loom" |
| **Starts with** | 0.9 | "loom" matches "LoomLite" |
| **Contains (substring)** | 0.7 × ratio × position | "loom" matches "The Loom Framework" |
| **Word boundary** | 0.6 | "pillar" matches "Pillars" (plural handling) |
| **Fuzzy character** | 0.3 | "lom" matches "loom" (typo tolerance) |

**Position weighting:** Matches earlier in the title score higher.  
**Ratio weighting:** Longer matches relative to title length score higher.

### 5.4. Multi-Word Search Logic

When a query contains multiple terms (e.g., "loom financials"), the system applies OR logic with intelligent weighting:

**Single term:** Direct fuzzy matching
```
Query: "loom"
→ Score each document by fuzzy title match
```

**Multiple terms:** OR logic with bonus for AND matches
```
Query: "loom financials"

IF all terms match:
  → Score = avg(term_scores) × 1.5  (50% bonus)
  → Example: "Loom Financial Model.pdf" = HIGH score

IF some terms match:
  → Score = avg(term_scores) × (matching_terms / total_terms)
  → Example: "Loom Framework.pdf" = MEDIUM score (1/2 terms)
  → Example: "Financial Analysis.pdf" = MEDIUM score (1/2 terms)

IF no terms match:
  → Score = 0.0
```

### 5.5. Weighted Fusion Formula

The final relevance score combines title matching and concept similarity:

```
final_score = (0.6 × title_score) + (0.4 × concept_score)
```

**Rationale:**
- **60% title weight:** Direct user intent, high precision
- **40% concept weight:** Semantic relevance, high recall
- **Threshold: 0.15:** Documents below this score are filtered out

### 5.6. Top Hits Dynamic Update

The Navigator's "Top Hits" section updates in real-time as users type:

**On search:**
1. Backend returns pre-ranked results
2. Frontend displays top 6 in Top Hits section
3. Each item shows match score as percentage badge
4. Items are clickable and load documents in split view

**On search clear:**
1. Top Hits restores to engagement-based ranking
2. Engagement score = 40% dwell time + 30% recency + 30% view frequency

**Search buffer:**
- 1-second persistence prevents flicker during rapid typing
- Clears automatically when search is empty

---

## 7. Frontend Integration Standards (v1.9)

### 7.1. Event Bus Communication

The frontend uses a centralized event bus for cross-module communication. All events are wrapped in `CustomEvent` with data in the `detail` property.

**Search Events:**

```javascript
// Emit search results (from searchBar.js)
bus.emit('searchResults', {
  query: 'loom',
  results: [...],
  documentScores: {...},
  threshold: 0.15,
  count: 4
});

// Listen for search results (in navigatorV2.js)
bus.on('searchResults', (event) => {
  const { query, results } = event.detail;  // MUST use event.detail
  updateTopHitsFromSearch(event.detail);
});

// Emit search cleared
bus.emit('searchCleared', {});
```

**Document Events:**

```javascript
// Emit document focus
bus.emit('documentFocus', { docId: 'doc_123' });

// Emit view mode change
bus.emit('viewModeChanged', { mode: 'split' });
```

**Critical:** Always access event data via `event.detail`, not directly from the event object.

### 7.2. Top Hits Component

**Location:** Navigator sidebar (top section)  
**Purpose:** Display the 6 most relevant documents based on current context

**States:**

1. **Default (No search):**
   - Shows engagement-based top hits

   - Loaded from `/api/files/top-hits` endpoint

2. **Active search:**
   - Shows search-based top hits
   - Displays top 6 results from `/search` endpoint
   - Each item shows match score as green percentage badge
   - Updates in real-time as user types

3. **Empty results:**
   - Shows "No matching documents" message
   - Does NOT persist stale results from previous searches

**Click Behavior:**
- Switches view mode to "split"
- Loads document in Solar System (top) and Mind Map (bottom)
- Emits `documentFocus` event with doc_id

### 7.3. Search Bar Component

**Location:** Top toolbar (center)  
**Purpose:** Accept user search queries and display autocomplete suggestions

**Features:**
- Debounced input (300ms delay)

## 11. Future Roadmap

### Phase 2B: Semantic Noise Resilience Layer (SNRL)

**Goal:** Integrate vector embeddings for true semantic search

**Architecture:**
```python
def hybrid_search(query: str):
    fuzzy_matches = fuzzy_lookup(query)      # ✅ Already implemented
    semantic_scores = vector_search(query)   # 🔜 Next step
    combined = rank_by_weight(fuzzy_matches, semantic_scores)
    return combined[:10]
```

**Integration Points:**
- Add Pinecone or Sentence-Transformer for embeddings
- Weight fusion: 0.4 lexical + 0.6 semantic
- Log semantic corrections in provenance events

**Benefits:**
- True meaning-based search (not just character matching)
- Handle synonyms and related concepts
- Improve recall without sacrificing precision
