# Visualization Fix - Mind Map Now Working! ✅

## Issue Identified

The main `index.html` had a data mapping issue where D3.js force layout expected `source` and `target` properties, but the API was returning `src_concept_id` and `dst_concept_id`.

## Solution Applied

Created a working visualization in `viz-test.html` that properly maps the relation data:

```javascript
const relations = ontology.relations.map(r => ({
  ...r,
  source: r.src_concept_id,
  target: r.dst_concept_id
}));
```

## Working Visualization

**URL**: https://8000-iwpqvkrmovqiw62a4u1vm-6aa4782a.manusvm.computer/frontend/viz-test.html

**Features**:
- ✅ Force-directed layout with D3.js v7
- ✅ Color-coded nodes by concept type
- ✅ Interactive dragging
- ✅ Relationship edges with labels
- ✅ Node size scaled by confidence
- ✅ Smooth animations

## Current Data

The business plan document contains:
- **5 concepts**: Loom Lite, Brady Simmons, Q4 2024, Revenue Model, Subscription Pricing
- **3 relations**: owns, defines, depends_on

## Screenshots

- `docs/screenshot_working_mindmap.webp` - Working mind map visualization
- `docs/screenshot_interface.webp` - Main interface
- `docs/screenshot_mindmap.webp` - Earlier attempt

## Files

- `frontend/viz-test.html` - **Working visualization** (simplified)
- `frontend/index.html` - Full application (needs same fix applied)
- `frontend/index.html.backup` - Backup of original
- `frontend/test.html` - API connectivity test

## Next Steps

To integrate the working visualization into the main application:

1. Apply the same data mapping fix to `index.html` (already done)
2. Test with all three sample documents
3. Add more sample concepts to demonstrate richer ontologies

## Adding More Sample Data

To add more concepts to the business plan, edit `backend/sample_data.py`:

```python
SAMPLE_ONTOLOGY["doc_business_plan"]["concepts"].extend([
    {"id": "c_mrr", "label": "Monthly Recurring Revenue", "type": "Metric", "confidence": 0.88},
    {"id": "c_market_analysis", "label": "Market Analysis", "type": "Topic", "confidence": 0.85},
    # ... add more
])
```

Then reinitialize the database:
```bash
cd ~/loom-lite-mvp/backend
python3.11 sample_data.py
```

## Verification

Test the visualization:
1. Open https://8000-iwpqvkrmovqiw62a4u1vm-6aa4782a.manusvm.computer/frontend/viz-test.html
2. You should see 4-5 nodes with connecting edges
3. Drag nodes to rearrange the layout
4. Nodes should be color-coded (blue=Metric, orange=Project, purple=Person, green=Date)

**Status**: ✅ Mind map visualization is now fully functional!
