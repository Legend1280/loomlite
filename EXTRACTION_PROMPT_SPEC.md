## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 What This Prompt Does

This prompt instructs GPT-5 to extract structured micro-ontologies from unstructured text documents. It produces:

1. **Spans** - Character-level text excerpts (provenance)
2. **Concepts** - Named entities with types and metadata
3. **Relations** - Typed connections between concepts
4. **Mentions** - Links between concepts and their source spans

### 1.2 What This Prompt Does NOT Do

- Does NOT summarize or paraphrase content
- Does NOT generate new information beyond what's in the text
- Does NOT perform sentiment analysis or opinion extraction
- Does NOT translate or modify the source text

### 1.3 Compliance Requirements

This prompt MUST comply with:
- **Ontology Standard v1.1** (ONTOLOGY_STANDARD_v1.1.md)
- **Database Schema v2** (schema_v2.sql)
- **MicroOntology JSON Structure** (models.py)

---

## 2. Current Prompt Text

**Location:** `/backend/extractor.py` (lines 21-93)

**Model:** `gpt-5`  
**Temperature:** `0.3` (deterministic)  
**Response Format:** `json_object` (structured output)

### 2.1 Full Prompt

```
You are an expert ontology extractor following the Loom Lite Ontology Standard v1.1.

Extract a structured micro-ontology from the text below. You MUST return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "spans": [
    {
      "start": <character_offset_int>,
      "end": <character_offset_int>,
      "text": "exact quoted text from document"
    }
  ],
  "concepts": [
    {
      "label": "Concept Name",
      "type": "Person|Project|Date|Metric|Technology|Feature|Process|Topic|Team",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "aliases": ["Alternative Name"],
      "tags": ["category", "domain"]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "src": "Source Concept Label",
      "rel": "defines|depends_on|owns|leads|enables|supports|contains|measures|precedes|provides|uses|develops|occurs_on|triggers|displays|controls|shows|performs|ensures|powers|produces",
      "dst": "Destination Concept Label",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ],
  "mentions": [
    {
      "concept_label": "Concept Name",
      "span_index": <index_in_spans_array>,
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ]
}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Spans (Provenance)**
   - Extract 15-30 key text spans that contain important information
   - Use EXACT character offsets (count from start of text)
   - Include the exact quoted text
   - Each span should be 10-100 characters

2. **Concepts (Entities)**
   - Extract 10-20 key concepts per chunk
   - Types: Person (people), Project (initiatives), Date (time), Metric (numbers/KPIs), Technology (tools/systems), Feature (capabilities), Process (workflows), Topic (subjects), Team (groups)
   - Confidence: 1.0 = explicitly stated, 0.7 = clearly implied, 0.5 = inferred
   - Include aliases (alternative names/abbreviations)
   - Add domain-relevant tags

3. **Relations (Connections)**
   - Create 5-15 meaningful relationships between concepts
   - Use ONLY the allowed verbs listed above
   - Both src and dst must be concept labels from the concepts array
   - Confidence based on how explicit the relationship is

4. **Mentions (Evidence)**
   - Link each concept to 1-3 spans where it appears
   - span_index refers to position in spans array (0-indexed)
   - This provides provenance for each concept

**Example:**
If text says "Brady Simmons founded Loom Lite in Q4 2024", extract:
- Span: {start: 0, end: 45, text: "Brady Simmons founded Loom Lite in Q4 2024"}
- Concepts: [{label: "Brady Simmons", type: "Person"}, {label: "Loom Lite", type: "Project"}, {label: "Q4 2024", type: "Date"}]
- Relations: [{src: "Brady Simmons", rel: "owns", dst: "Loom Lite"}]
- Mentions: [{concept_label: "Brady Simmons", span_index: 0, confidence: 1.0}, ...]

**Text to analyze:**
```

## 3. Prompt Design Rationale

### 3.1 Why This Structure?

**Explicit Schema Definition**
- Provides GPT-5 with exact JSON structure to follow
- Reduces hallucination and format errors
- Ensures compatibility with database schema

**Numbered Requirements**
- Clear, scannable instructions
- Easy to reference in debugging
- Hierarchical organization

**Concrete Example**
- Shows GPT-5 exactly what output looks like
- Demonstrates all four components working together
- Uses realistic domain example

**Quantitative Targets**
- "15-30 spans" - Prevents too few or too many extractions
- "10-20 concepts" - Balances coverage vs. noise
- "5-15 relations" - Ensures meaningful connections

### 3.2 Why These Constraints?

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Character offsets (not line numbers) | Database stores character positions; enables precise text highlighting |
| Exact quoted text in spans | Validates offset accuracy; provides human-readable provenance |
| Fixed concept types | Maintains taxonomy consistency; enables type-based filtering |
| Fixed relation verbs | Prevents semantic drift; enables relationship querying |
| Confidence scores | Captures extraction uncertainty; enables quality filtering |
| Span length 10-100 chars | Too short = no context; too long = too much noise |

## 4. Known Issues & Limitations

### 4.1 Current Issues

**‚ö†Ô∏è UNVERIFIED - NEEDS TESTING**

1. **Character Offset Accuracy**
   - GPT-5 may struggle with exact character counting
   - Chunked text complicates offset calculation
   - **Risk:** Spans may not align with actual text positions

2. **Mention Linking**
   - GPT-5 must correctly index spans array
   - Off-by-one errors possible
   - **Risk:** Broken provenance links

3. **Concept Deduplication**
   - Same concept may appear in multiple chunks
   - Prompt doesn't specify how to handle duplicates
   - **Risk:** Redundant concepts in database

4. **Relation Validation**
   - GPT-5 may create relations between non-existent concepts
   - src/dst must match concept labels exactly
   - **Risk:** Orphaned relations

### 4.2 Edge Cases

**Empty Documents**
- What if text is too short (< 100 chars)?
- Should return empty arrays or error?

**Non-English Text**
- Prompt is in English; does it work for other languages?
- Concept types may not translate well

**Highly Technical Text**
- Medical, legal, scientific jargon
- May need domain-specific concept types

**Ambiguous References**
- "He", "it", "the company" - how to handle?
- Should GPT-5 resolve coreferences?

---

## 5. Validation & Testing

### 5.1 Test Cases

**Test 1: Simple Document**
```
Input: "Brady Simmons founded Loom Lite in Q4 2024."
Expected:
- 1 span
- 3 concepts (Person, Project, Date)
- 1 relation (owns)
- 3 mentions
```

**Test 2: Complex Business Plan**
```
Input: Pillars Financial Business Plan (8 pages)
Expected:
- 50-100 spans
- 30-60 concepts (mix of types)
- 20-40 relations
- 60-120 mentions
```

**Test 3: Edge Case - Very Short**
```
Input: "Hello world"
Expected:
- 0-1 spans
- 0 concepts
- 0 relations
- 0 mentions
```

### 5.2 Quality Metrics

**Precision**
- Are extracted concepts actually in the text?
- Are relations semantically correct?

**Recall**
- Are key concepts being missed?
- Are important relationships overlooked?

**Provenance Accuracy**
- Do character offsets match actual text?
- Are mentions correctly linked to spans?

**Consistency**
- Same document ‚Üí same extraction (with temp=0.3)?
- Similar documents ‚Üí similar concept types?
