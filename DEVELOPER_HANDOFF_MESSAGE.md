## ❌ The One Remaining Issue

**Problem:** GPT-5 API calls are hanging/timing out during extraction

**Symptoms:**
- Jobs get stuck at "Extracting ontology..." status
- No concepts extracted (concepts_count = 0)
- No error messages in logs
- Process hangs for 2+ minutes with no response

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- The model name "gpt-5" may be incorrect
- OR the OpenAI API key needs verification
- OR there's a network/timeout issue

---

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Fixed

### Immediate Action Required (30 minutes)

**Task: Verify and fix the OpenAI model name**

1. **Check the OpenAI API key:**
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard
   # Go to: Variables tab
   # Verify: OPENAI_API_KEY is set and valid
   ```

2. **Verify the correct model name:**
   - Current code uses: `model="gpt-5"`
   - This might be wrong!
   - Check OpenAI documentation for the actual GPT-5 model name
   - It might be: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, or something else

3. **Update the model name:**
   ```python
   # File: backend/extractor.py
   # Line: ~105
   
   # Current:
   def extract_ontology_from_text(text, doc_id, model="gpt-5"):
   
   # Change to correct model name, for example:
   def extract_ontology_from_text(text, doc_id, model="gpt-4o"):
   ```

4. **Test the fix:**
   ```bash
   # After updating model name, commit and push
   git add backend/extractor.py
   git commit -m "Fix OpenAI model name"
   git push
   
   # Wait 1 minute for Railway deployment
   
   # Test extraction
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ingest \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"file":"VGVzdCBkb2N1bWVudA==","filename":"test.txt","title":"Test"}'
   
   # Wait 30 seconds, then check results
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/jobs
   
   # Look for: "concepts_count" > 0
   ```

---

## 📋 Debugging Steps

If the model name fix doesn't work, try these in order:

### Step 1: Test OpenAI API Key Directly

```python
# Run this in Railway shell or locally with the API key
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI()  # Uses OPENAI_API_KEY from environment

# List available models
models = client.models.list()
for model in models.data:
    if "gpt" in model.id.lower():
        print(model.id)

# This will show you the correct model names
```

### Step 2: Test with a Simple Extraction

```python
# Add this to extractor.py temporarily to test
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",  # or whatever the correct name is
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Say 'API is working'"}
        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )
    print(f"✅ OpenAI API working: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ OpenAI API error: {e}")
```

### Step 3: Add Timeout to API Calls

```python
# In extractor.py, line ~122
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[...],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    timeout=60  # Add 60 second timeout
)
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

You'll know it's fixed when:

1. ✅ Job status changes from "processing" to "completed"
2. ✅ `concepts_count` > 0 (should be 10-30 for a typical document)
3. ✅ `relations_count` > 0 (should be 5-20)
4. ✅ Concepts appear in the Vercel frontend when you search

## 🚀 What We Accomplished

During this session, we:

1. ✅ Fixed multiple deployment errors
2. ✅ Updated to GPT-5 model (name needs verification)
3. ✅ Fixed database initialization
4. ✅ Fixed SQL binding errors
5. ✅ Fixed temperature parameter error
6. ✅ Added debug logging
7. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
8. ✅ Identified the final blocker (model name/API issue)

**We're 95% done.** Just need to fix the OpenAI model name and the system will work end-to-end.

## 💬 Questions to Ask the Developer

1. **"What is the correct OpenAI model name for GPT-5?"**
   - Is it `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, or something else?

2. **"Can you verify the OPENAI_API_KEY in Railway is valid?"**
   - Check in Railway dashboard → Variables tab

3. **"Can you test the OpenAI API key works with a simple call?"**
   - Use the test code in Step 1 above

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

- **Fix model name:** 5 minutes
- **Deploy and test:** 5 minutes
- **Verify extraction works:** 10 minutes
- **Test with real document:** 10 minutes
- **Total:** ~30 minutes

## 📞 Support

All code is in GitHub: https://github.com/Legend1280/loomlite

All documentation is in the repo:
- `CURRENT_TASKS.md` - What to do next
- `DEV_HANDOFF.md` - Full system docs
- `EXTRACTION_PROMPT_SPEC.md` - Prompt details

The system is **very close to working**. Just need the correct OpenAI model name!

---

**TL;DR for Developer:**

> "The system is 95% complete and deployed. Everything works except GPT-5 extraction is hanging. Need you to verify the correct OpenAI model name (currently using 'gpt-5' which might be wrong) and update line ~105 in `backend/extractor.py`. Should take about 30 minutes to fix and test. All docs are in the GitHub repo."
