## 🎯 What's New in v5.1

### Hybrid Search Pipeline (v1.9)

The headline feature of v5.1 is a production-ready **hybrid search system** that combines fuzzy lexical matching with semantic concept scoring:

**Backend Layer:**
- Fuzzy title matching with 5-tier scoring hierarchy
- Multi-word search with OR logic and AND bonuses
- Weighted fusion: 60% title + 40% concept
- Lowered threshold to 0.15 for better recall
- All scoring logic centralized in backend

**Frontend Layer:**
- Simplified to pure UI rendering (28% less code)
- Dynamic Top Hits that update in real-time
- Fixed event.detail bug for proper event handling
- 1-second search buffer prevents flicker

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consistent:** Search and Top Hits use same backend logic
- ✅ **Scalable:** Backend handles heavy lifting
- ✅ **Auditable:** Single source of truth for search scoring
- ✅ **Extensible:** Ready for vector embeddings (SNRL v6.0)

### Search Features

#### Fuzzy Matching
Handles typos, plurals, and variations:
- "pillar" matches "Pillars" (word boundary)
- "lom" matches "loom" (character fuzzy)
- "executive" matches "1. Executive summary.pdf" (position-weighted)

#### Multi-Word Search
Intelligent OR logic with weighting:
- **"loom financials"** → "Loom Financial Model.pdf" (both terms) = HIGH score
- **"loom financials"** → "Loom Framework.pdf" (one term) = MEDIUM score
- **"loom financials"** → "Financial Analysis.pdf" (one term) = MEDIUM score

#### Dynamic Top Hits
Real-time updates as you type:
- Shows top 6 most relevant documents
- Match score displayed as green percentage badge
- Click to load document in split view
- Automatically restores engagement-based ranking when search is cleared

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Search Algorithm

**Fuzzy Title Matching:**
```
Exact match:       1.0  ("loom" = "Loom")
Starts with:       0.9  ("loom" → "LoomLite")
Contains:          0.7  ("loom" in "The Loom Framework")
Word boundary:     0.6  ("pillar" → "Pillars")
Fuzzy character:   0.3  ("lom" → "loom")
```

**Multi-Word Logic:**
```
Query: "loom financials"

All terms match:
  score = avg(term_scores) × 1.5
  Example: "Loom Financial Model.pdf" → 1.35

Some terms match:
  score = avg(term_scores) × (matching / total)
  Example: "Loom Framework.pdf" → 0.45 (1/2 terms)
```

**Weighted Fusion:**
```
final_score = (0.6 × title_score) + (0.4 × concept_score)
threshold = 0.15
```

### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Target | Current | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Search query | < 150ms | ~60-70ms | ✅ |
| Document load | < 500ms | ~300ms | ✅ |
| Provenance fetch | < 200ms | ~150ms | ✅ |
| Galaxy render | < 1000ms | ~800ms | ✅ |

### Code Reduction

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| navigatorV2.js | 225 lines | 163 lines | -28% |
| Search logic | Frontend | Backend | 100% moved |
| Complexity | High | Low | Simplified |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 2B: Semantic Noise Resilience Layer (SNRL)

**Timeline:** Q1 2026  
**Goal:** Integrate vector embeddings for true semantic search

**Features:**
- Vector embeddings via Pinecone or Sentence-Transformer
- Semantic similarity scoring (not just character matching)
- Handle synonyms and related concepts
- Weight fusion: 0.4 lexical + 0.6 semantic
- Provenance logging for semantic corrections

**Benefits:**
- Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
- "financial model" matches "revenue projections"
- "physician partnership" matches "doctor collaboration"
- Improved recall without sacrificing precision

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features

**Timeline:** Q2 2026  
**Goal:** Scale to enterprise deployments

**Features:**
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Advanced provenance analytics
- Custom ontology templates
